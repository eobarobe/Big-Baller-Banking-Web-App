        Interfaces

              implement all abstract methods!)

            - all fields declared within are implicitly public, static, and final
            - all method stubs declared within are implicitly public and abstract
            - methods with implementations are permitted in two ways: static and default methods
                + static methods cannot be overridden by implementing classes (but can be redeclared/shadowed)
                + default methods can be overridden by implementing classes (introduced in Java 8)
